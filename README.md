This program serves as a credit project for the university course Computer Graphics 2. It focuses on the vizualization of a Mandelbulb cloud plot.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:  
Python was chosen due to its library for data processing PyTorch

VIZUALIZATION:   
For the vizualization and user iteraction, Matplotlib was used

CODE STRUCTURE: 
The code  is divided into two components: main.py and mandelbulb.py
- main.py:  
  Contains plot_mandelbulb function that vizualize the mandelbulb and handles the user input
- mandelbulb.py:  
  Defines the generate_mandelbulb function, which calculated the Mandelbulb point cloud

USAGE:  
Run main.py. Use sliders in Matplotlib user interface to modify the generated Mandelbulb.
